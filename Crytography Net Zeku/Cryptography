what is cryptography? Cryptography is the use of mathematical algorithms to transform information into a form that is not readable by unauthorized individuals.

Cryptography does, however, provide authorized individuals with the ability to transform that encrypted information back into readable form.
Cryptography depends upon two basic operations:
The first, encryption, converts information from its plain text form into an encrypted version that is unreadable.
This is known as cipher text. The second operation, decryption, performs the reverse transformation, using an algorithm to transform that encrypted cipher text back into plain text format.
