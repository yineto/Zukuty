As is expected, encryption takes plain text and turns it into cipher text by using a key or a key pair. 
The result is a meaningless message, unless you have a key.
We can use http://atom.smasher.org/pgp/ to see an example the result from ecnryption a plain text message.

There are Two Main Types of encryption:
Asymmetric encryption, also called public key encryption, and symmetric encryption, also called conventional encryption.
